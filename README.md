## Future 👀

We know that our project is far from being over. Because of the time we didn't do what we really wanted to. We would like to put a webGL planet with bubble songs around in the home page. However we didn't manage to control the "click" on it so we changed it for something way more easier.
We would have liked to have a custom feature bigger. For exemple add a titlle or chose between diferent stamps.
